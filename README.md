# GoodBuy(e) App: College Item Marketplace


---

## 📌 Introduction

Transitioning in and out of college is a unique phase, filled with possessions that carry emotional and practical value. For many departing students, there's an array of items they'd prefer to sell. Conversely, incoming freshers often look for essential college items without breaking the bank. **GoodBuy(e) App** is the bridge connecting these two cohorts, ensuring a smooth transition for both.

## 🚀 Motivation

While colleges are hubs for peer-to-peer exchanges, connecting buyers and sellers seamlessly remains a challenge. Negotiations can often be tricky or non-existent. Our platform not only eases the discovery of items but also offers a platform for healthy negotiation, ensuring both parties benefit.
